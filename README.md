## About the Project

In early 2020, Riot Games announced it would no longer maintain the Boards and that the platform would be sunset two weeks after the announcement. This led to a mad dash to scrape and download as much of the Boards data as possible, which ultimately led to a large number of .json files housing the data for millions of users, comments, and threads across several regional platforms.

The League Boards Archive project aims to not only provide an interface for this raw data that allows for users to see the conversations between 2014 and 2020, but also to maintain an experience that is as true to form to the original League of Legends Boards.
